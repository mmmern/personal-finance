    "# Initial Retirement Assets\n",
    "The main question when planning financially for retirement is \"How much do I need to save?\" The answer, of course, is highly dependent on a similar question, \"How much money will I need in retirement?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, for many people, the single number estimate of how much money they will need is surprisingly large. Since retirement is expected to last for quite a long time, it's natural to wonder if it's reasonable to extend savings throughout retirement by investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well-known rules of thumb answer this. Advisors suggest drawing down 3% or 4%, based on a [thirty-year old study](http://www.retailinvestor.org/pdf/Bengen1.pdf) by William Bergen. This rule of thumb can be easily manipulated to determine how much money one should have at the beginning of retirement. However, there are hidden market, interest-rate, and portfolio assumptions behind that simple rule of thumb.\n",

    "Rather than rely on these hidden assumptions, you can calculate how much you'll need at the start of retirement using this notebook"
